    You are being invited to take part in some questionnaires and tests for synesthesia and other mental processes.

    OUR CONDUCT CODE: Your decision to take part is voluntary and you may refuse to take part any time during the test 
    or refuse to answer any question. The purpose of our research is to advance knowledge about synesthesia and other 
    mental processes, so we will process your personal information and test-responses to that end. When the test is 
    done, you will be given an automated score (to suggest whether you may be synesthetic) and your details will enter 
    into our secure database.
    `;

    `
    From time to time we also re-contact certain people to take part in further studies, but participation is entirely 
    voluntary and you are under no obligation to take part further. Once you finish the test we will store your 
    responses to the questions and decisions made in the test (your data) in a computer database. If you decide to 
    withdraw your data, you can contact the administrator to remove your data. We will handle your information in 
    accordance with Japanâ€™s personal information protection legislation, subject to legal limitations. Your personal 
    information (e.g., email) will remain strictly confidential and never be shared outside our research group, unless 
    you first give permission. Without this, only de-identified (anonymized) data may be made available to other 
    research collaborators, as determined from time to time by the research group. If you are referred to the website 
    by another researcher, you can choose to share the data of your responses to the tests specific to the researcher 
    through our website by inputting the account name of the researcher. In this case, the researcher who receives the 
    data will know the data are from you. The research group managing this website will still have access to all the 
    data you provide to the website. The research group managing this website may share de-identified responses to tests 
    to collaborators outside the research group managing this website. In this case, the shared data will be anonymous 
    and cannot be associated to you.

    The Synesthesia Battery involves taking simple computerized tests and questionnaires. Your results will be 
    anonymously added to a database that researchers can access to learn more about synesthesia. If you have been
